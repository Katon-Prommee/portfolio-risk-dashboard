Portfolio Risk Analysis
Overview

This project demonstrates portfolio risk analysis using historical financial data. It calculates key risk metrics for a simple portfolio of QQQ, SPY, and GLD, including:

- Daily and annualized volatility

- Value at Risk (VaR) at multiple confidence levels

- Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR)

- Skewness and kurtosis

- Maximum Drawdown

- Stress testing for specific market events (e.g., COVID-19, 2008 Financial Crisis)

- Visualization of cumulative returns and drawdowns

The goal is to provide a clear, reproducible workflow to assess portfolio risk using Python and open-source data.

#Features

- Fetch historical price data from Yahoo Finance using yfinance

- Calculate portfolio daily returns with custom weights

- Compute key risk metrics (VaR, CVaR, volatility, skewness, kurtosis, max drawdown)

- Interactive stress testing for user-defined periods and confidence levels

- Visualize cumulative returns and drawdowns with matplotlib
